# Secure Password Web Toolkit üõ°Ô∏èüîë

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is currently a work in progress (WIP). Features and documentation may be incomplete or subject to change.**

## Overview

The Secure Password Web Toolkit is a collection of web-based tools designed to help users generate, analyze, and manage secure passwords. This project aims to provide a simple, accessible interface for common password security needs while maintaining strong security practices.

## Features (Planned/In Development)

- **Password Generator**: Create strong, random passwords with customizable options
- **Password Strength Analyzer**: Evaluate the security of existing passwords
- **Passphrase Generator**: Generate memorable yet secure passphrases
- **Security Tips**: Educational resources about password best practices
- (More features to be added during development)

## Installation

As this is a web-based toolkit, there are two ways to use it:

1. **Use the live version** (when available)
2. **Local development**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChChandan/Secure-password-web-toolkit.git
   cd Secure-password-web-toolkit
   # Open index.html in your browser
   ```

## Contributing

Since this project is currently in development, contributions are especially welcome! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. Submit a pull request

Open an issue first to discuss major changes or new features.

## Security Note

While we aim to implement strong security practices, please note:
- This toolkit runs entirely client-side (no server processing of your passwords)
- We recommend never entering your actual important passwords into any online tool
- This is currently a work in progress - use at your own discretion

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete core password generation functionality
- [ ] Implement password strength analysis
- [ ] Add UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Include comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Security audit of all code
